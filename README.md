## Stakeholders

### Stakeholder analysis

ShareX is maintained under the GNU General Public License. It was created and is maintained by ShareX Team, which is located in Turkey, but everyone can contribute to the software, by issuing pull requests. To contribute, one must use Visual Studio 2015 and CodeMade, to format the code. The steps to contribute are described on their [wiki page](https://github.com/ShareX/ShareX/wiki/Code-contribution). 

The most important stakeholders that are identified based on the categorization of Rozanski and Woods [1] are discussed below.

The **users** of ShareX consist of everyone that uses the application to perform any screen sharing action provided by the application. ShareX is used ostly by non-commercial users wishing to perform more advanced screen capturing tasks, that are not natively available on Windows. Similarly, commercial users of the application use it for the same purposes as non-commercial users. There are no commercial parties that acknowledge that they specifically use ShareX.

The current most active **maintainer** of the project is the user [Jaex](https://github.com/Jaex), which is the ShareX Team. They are actively involved in the development and they oversee and and review all new contributions to assure the quality of the project.

The community offers **support** using the GitHub issue system. This support is provided by the community of ShareX, here different kind of stakeholders ask for support, ask questions and they submit bug reports and feature requests. Support at issues is often provided by the maintainer, though sometimes other community-members get involved.

### Context Viewpoint

![Context viewpoint of ShareX](http://i.imgur.com/HniXL8t.png?1 "Context viewpoint of ShareX")
*Context viewpoint of ShareX*

ShareXis a completely open source project and GitHub is the main platform in which it is developed. Like any project hosted in GitHub, the developers come from everywhere as long as they are interested in ShareX and are willing to contribute. Nevertheless, the maintainer and owner of the project is the ShareX Team. Those people are the core developers of the ShareX. 

ShareX's main data source are programs and applications screens, which the user wants to capture. As an open source project, users can easily download the source code and build the program from GitHub. ShareX can run on on Windows, mainly because it is developed in C#.

## Releases

The ShareX Team started the development of ShareX in 2010, releasing a major update every month or so. The latest version released is V11.3.0, which was released in September, 2016. Prior to version 6.0.0, ShareX was called ZUploader.

Below, are presented the changes implemented on the major version releases, since its name change to ShareX:

## Architecture

In this section we aim to give the reader more insight into the architecture of the application. The component structure of the application is explained and visualized using a diagram. 

### Component Structure

ShareX consists of 12 projects that are related to each other, and their relationship are visualized in the image below. The main components are:

* **ShareX**: This is the project that binds together all the others. It is mainly responsible for the menus, app configurations, helpers and managers. It also defines forms for configurations such as: hotkeys, after capture and upload actions, encoders, notifications, quick tasks, color picker, screen recording, first time configuration, etc.
*  **ShareX.HelpersLib**: This project defines helpers that are user throughout the entire system. Almost all other projects depends somehow on this one. It defines things such as automation, the command line tool, cryptography, name parsers, tokenizers, printer options, extensions, forms, GIF definitions, colors, update checker and more.
* **ShareX.HistoryLib**: This projects is responsible for the History feature of the app. It keeps track of the screen captures, and present them in a list, sorted by date.
* **ShareX.ImageEffectsLib**: This project is responsible for the image effects feature. When you perform a capture, you can add effects, such as blur, emboss, edge detection, pixelate, shadow, sharpen, and much more. You can also, resize and crop, flip, rotate, scale, and skew. And also you can draw on the image you captured.
* **ShareX.IndexerLib**: Responsible for the app's indexer. It defines the configurations for indexing files and folders.
* **ShareX.MediaLib**: Responsible for the video capturing configurations, such as mpeg codecs, video thumbnailer, etc.
* **ShareX.ScreenCaptureLib**: Responsible for the screen capturing process. Defines the classes for region capture, screen capture, screen recording, webpage capture and scrolling capturing.
* **ShareX.Setup**: Reponsible for the system setup. It uses AppVeyor to create the executables, both the complete and portable, and also the Steam folder, which is used to publish the app on Steam.
* **ShareX.Uploaders**: Responsible for defining the image, text and file uploaders as well as the URL shortener services and sharing services, such as email, Facebook, Google+, Twitter, Reddit, and so on.
* **ShareX.Chrome**: Defines the Chrome Extension.
* **ShareX.Steam**: ShareX is also available on the Steam Store. This project is responsible for defining that.
* **Greenshot.ImageEditor**: This Greenshot image editor is used when the user wants to do more advanced editing to an image. It defines all the configurations, controls, interfaces as well as the core of the editing tool.
